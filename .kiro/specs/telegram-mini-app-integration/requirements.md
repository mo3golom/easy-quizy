# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Telegram Mini App integration to the existing quiz application, enabling users to play quizzes directly within Telegram. The integration includes SDK setup, user identification through Telegram ID, and native Telegram UI components like the back button.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing the quiz through Telegram, I want the app to automatically detect I'm in a Telegram environment, so that I get the appropriate Telegram-specific features and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL detect if it's running inside a Telegram Mini App environment
2. WHEN running inside Telegram THEN the system SHALL initialize the Telegram SDK properly
3. WHEN running outside Telegram THEN the system SHALL continue to work with existing functionality
4. IF Telegram SDK initialization fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to standard web behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user playing quizzes in Telegram, I want my Telegram user ID to be used for game sessions, so that my progress and results are properly tracked without manual registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user is in Telegram Mini App THEN the system SHALL extract the Telegram user ID
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL send Telegram ID in X-Player-ID header
3. WHEN user is not in Telegram THEN the system SHALL continue using existing player ID generation logic
4. WHEN Telegram ID is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to existing ID mechanism
5. IF API request fails due to player ID issues THEN the system SHALL retry with fallback ID

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user navigating in Telegram Mini App, I want to see a native back button, so that I can easily return to previous screens using familiar Telegram interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user is on game page in Telegram THEN the system SHALL show Telegram's native back button
2. WHEN back button is pressed THEN the system SHALL navigate to the home page
3. WHEN user leaves game page THEN the system SHALL hide the back button
4. WHEN not in Telegram environment THEN the system SHALL not show Telegram back button
5. IF back button API fails THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without breaking navigation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Telegram SDK to be properly installed and configured, so that all Telegram Mini App features work reliably across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application starts THEN the system SHALL load @telegram-apps/sdk version 3.x
2. WHEN SDK is loaded THEN the system SHALL initialize it globally on all pages
3. WHEN initialization completes THEN the system SHALL make Telegram features available throughout the app
4. IF SDK fails to load THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue without Telegram features
5. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide debugging information for Telegram integration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly whether I access it through Telegram or directly in a browser, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of the access method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing via browser THEN the system SHALL work with all existing functionality
2. WHEN accessing via Telegram THEN the system SHALL enhance the experience with Telegram features
3. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL maintain game state consistency
4. IF environment detection fails THEN the system SHALL default to browser mode
5. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use appropriate player identification for each environment
