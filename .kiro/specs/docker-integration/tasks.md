# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Configure SvelteKit for SSR production builds
  - Switch from `@sveltejs/adapter-static` to `@sveltejs/adapter-node` in svelte.config.js
  - Update package.json to include adapter-node dependency
  - Configure adapter-node settings for Docker deployment
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Create multi-stage Dockerfile for unified deployment
  - Create Dockerfile with frontend builder stage using node:20-alpine
  - Add backend builder stage using golang:1.21-alpine for Go compilation
  - Implement final runtime stage combining both services
  - Configure proper file copying and dependency installation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 8.1, 8.2_

- [x] 3. Implement service startup orchestration in Docker
  - Create startup script to run both Go backend and Node.js SSR server concurrently
  - Configure proper process management and signal handling
  - Set up port configuration (Go on 8080, SSR on 3000)
  - Implement graceful shutdown handling
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.5_

- [x] 4. Configure API routing and proxy setup
  - Set up Vite development server proxy configuration for `/api/*` routes
  - Configure production SSR server to handle API routing to Go backend
  - Update CORS configuration in Go backend for development and production
  - Test API communication between frontend and backend services
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [x] 5. Create development script with multiple modes
  - Create `dev.sh` script in project root with executable permissions
  - Implement `full` mode to start both Go backend and SvelteKit frontend
  - Implement `client` mode to start only frontend with external API configuration
  - Add dependency checking and automatic installation where possible
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 6.3_

- [x] 6. Create comprehensive documentation and setup instructions
  - Update README.md with Docker build and run instructions
  - Document development script usage and modes
  - Add troubleshooting section for common issues
  - Include examples for different deployment scenarios
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.4_
