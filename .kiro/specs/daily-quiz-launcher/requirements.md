# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a daily quiz section to the main page of the Easy Quizy application. Users will be able to start a daily quiz directly from the homepage without needing to know the game ID beforehand. The system will automatically fetch the daily game ID from the API and redirect users to the appropriate game page.

2. WHEN the daily quiz section is displayed THEN it SHALL have a design consistent with the existing ApiQuizResult component layout
3. WHEN the daily quiz section is rendered THEN it SHALL show descriptive text about the daily quiz on the left side and a prominent "Play" button on the right side

### Requirement 2

2. WHEN the button is in loading state THEN it SHALL be disabled to prevent multiple requests
3. WHEN the API request completes (success or failure) THEN the system SHALL remove the loading state
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display the error message and re-enable the button

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the daily quiz section to integrate seamlessly with the existing homepage design, so that the interface feels cohesive.
