# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a global alert and toast notification system for the Easy Quizy web application. The system will provide a centralized way to display user feedback messages including errors, warnings, information, and success notifications across all pages of the application. The system will use daisyUI components for consistent styling and provide both automatic and manual dismissal options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see error messages in a consistent toast notification format, so that I can easily understand when something goes wrong in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any part of the application THEN the system SHALL display an error toast notification
2. WHEN an error toast is displayed THEN it SHALL use daisyUI alert component with error styling
3. WHEN an error toast is displayed THEN it SHALL include a close button for manual dismissal
4. WHEN an error toast is displayed THEN it SHALL automatically close after 5 seconds
5. WHEN multiple error messages occur THEN each SHALL be displayed as a separate toast

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see different types of notifications (success, warning, info) in distinct visual styles, so that I can quickly understand the nature of each message.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a success action occurs THEN the system SHALL display a success toast with appropriate green styling
2. WHEN a warning situation occurs THEN the system SHALL display a warning toast with appropriate yellow styling
3. WHEN informational content needs to be shown THEN the system SHALL display an info toast with appropriate blue styling
4. WHEN each toast type is displayed THEN it SHALL use daisyUI alert component with corresponding semantic colors
5. WHEN any toast is displayed THEN it SHALL include an appropriate icon for the message type

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want toast notifications to appear in a consistent location that doesn't interfere with my workflow, so that I can continue using the application while being aware of system messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any toast notification is displayed THEN it SHALL appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen
2. WHEN toast notifications are displayed THEN they SHALL be positioned above all other page elements
3. WHEN toast notifications are displayed THEN they SHALL use fixed positioning to remain visible during scrolling
4. WHEN the toast container is positioned THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing page content or navigation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the toast notification system to manage multiple messages gracefully, so that I'm not overwhelmed by too many notifications at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN more than 3 toast notifications are active THEN the system SHALL stack additional toasts using daisyUI stack component
2. WHEN toasts are stacked THEN only the top 3 SHALL be fully visible
3. WHEN a visible toast is dismissed THEN the next stacked toast SHALL become visible
4. WHEN toasts are stacked THEN they SHALL maintain their chronological order (newest on top)
5. WHEN the stack contains toasts THEN users SHALL be able to see an indication of how many additional toasts are stacked

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple API to trigger toast notifications from any component, so that I can easily integrate error handling and user feedback throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component needs to show a toast THEN it SHALL be able to call a simple function with message and type parameters
2. WHEN the toast API is called THEN it SHALL accept message text, toast type, and optional duration parameters
3. WHEN the toast system is initialized THEN it SHALL be available globally across all pages and components
4. WHEN a toast is triggered THEN it SHALL be added to the global toast queue automatically
5. WHEN the toast API is used THEN it SHALL provide TypeScript type safety for all parameters

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want existing error messages throughout the application to be migrated to the new toast system, so that I have a consistent experience across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing error handling in ApiQuizQuestion component occurs THEN it SHALL use the new toast system instead of inline error display
2. WHEN existing error handling in ApiQuizResult component occurs THEN it SHALL use the new toast system instead of inline error display
3. WHEN API errors occur in the client.ts module THEN they SHALL trigger appropriate toast notifications
4. WHEN form validation errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed using the toast system
5. WHEN all existing error displays are migrated THEN no inline error messages SHALL remain in the application

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want toast notifications to be accessible and follow web accessibility standards, so that all users can receive important system feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a toast notification appears THEN it SHALL be announced to screen readers
2. WHEN toast notifications are displayed THEN they SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and roles
3. WHEN users navigate with keyboard THEN they SHALL be able to dismiss toasts using keyboard shortcuts
4. WHEN toast notifications use colors for meaning THEN they SHALL also include text or icons to convey the same information
5. WHEN toast notifications are displayed THEN they SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
