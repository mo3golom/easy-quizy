# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a unified Docker deployment solution for the Easy Quizy application, combining the Go backend and SvelteKit frontend into a single Docker image. The solution will support both production deployment and local development workflows, with a development script that can run services in different modes for optimal developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to build and deploy a single Docker image containing both backend and frontend, so that I can simplify deployment and reduce infrastructure complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the Docker image THEN the system SHALL create a multi-stage build with separate stages for frontend build, backend build, and final runtime
2. WHEN the frontend build stage executes THEN it SHALL compile the SvelteKit application using adapter-node for SSR support
3. WHEN the backend build stage executes THEN it SHALL compile the Go application into a static binary
4. WHEN the final runtime stage executes THEN it SHALL combine both the compiled frontend and backend into a single runnable image
5. WHEN the Docker image is built THEN it SHALL expose port 3000 for external access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Docker container to run both services simultaneously, so that the application works as a cohesive unit in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker container starts THEN it SHALL launch both the Go backend server and the Node.js frontend server concurrently
2. WHEN both servers are running THEN the frontend SHALL be accessible on the main port (3000)
3. WHEN API requests are made to `/api/*` paths THEN they SHALL be properly routed to the Go backend server
4. WHEN static assets are requested THEN they SHALL be served by the frontend server
5. WHEN either service fails THEN the container SHALL exit with an appropriate error code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a development script that can run services in different modes, so that I can work efficiently in various development scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `./dev.sh` without arguments THEN the system SHALL start both backend and frontend services in full development mode
2. WHEN running `./dev.sh full` THEN the system SHALL start both Go backend (via `go run`) and SvelteKit frontend (via `npm run dev`) concurrently
3. WHEN running `./dev.sh client` THEN the system SHALL start only the frontend service configured to use an external API
4. WHEN running `./dev.sh` with invalid arguments THEN the system SHALL display usage instructions and exit with error code
5. WHEN the development script starts services THEN it SHALL provide clear console output indicating which services are starting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to be configured for SSR in production while maintaining SPA behavior in development, so that I get optimal performance in both environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the SvelteKit application SHALL use adapter-node for server-side rendering
2. WHEN running in development mode THEN the SvelteKit application SHALL use the standard development server with hot reloading
3. WHEN the production build is created THEN it SHALL generate both client-side and server-side bundles
4. WHEN the SSR server runs THEN it SHALL serve pre-rendered HTML for initial page loads
5. WHEN the SSR server runs THEN it SHALL handle client-side navigation after initial load

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper API proxying configuration, so that frontend requests reach the backend correctly in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the frontend development server SHALL proxy `/api/*` requests to the Go backend server
2. WHEN running in production Docker container THEN API requests SHALL be handled by internal service communication
3. WHEN the Go backend server starts THEN it SHALL listen on a port that doesn't conflict with the frontend server
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL include proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests in development
5. WHEN the backend server handles requests THEN it SHALL respond with appropriate content-type headers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development environment to closely mirror production, so that I can catch deployment issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the development script THEN the Go backend SHALL use the same configuration and dependencies as production
2. WHEN running the development script THEN the frontend SHALL use the same build tools and dependencies as production
3. WHEN environment variables are used THEN they SHALL be consistently handled between development and production
4. WHEN the development environment starts THEN it SHALL use the same port configuration as production where possible
5. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the development script SHALL ensure all required packages are available

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and easy setup, so that new team members can quickly start contributing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is cloned THEN the README SHALL contain clear instructions for both Docker and development setup
2. WHEN following the setup instructions THEN a new developer SHALL be able to run the application within 10 minutes
3. WHEN using the development script THEN it SHALL automatically install missing dependencies where possible
4. WHEN Docker commands are documented THEN they SHALL include examples for common use cases (build, run, debug)
5. WHEN troubleshooting information is provided THEN it SHALL cover common issues with ports, dependencies, and environment setup

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Docker image to be optimized for size and security, so that deployments are efficient and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker image is built THEN it SHALL use Alpine Linux base images to minimize size
2. WHEN the final image is created THEN it SHALL only contain runtime dependencies, not build tools
3. WHEN the Docker image runs THEN it SHALL run as a non-root user for security
4. WHEN building the image THEN it SHALL use Docker layer caching effectively to speed up rebuilds
5. WHEN the image is analyzed THEN it SHALL not contain unnecessary files or sensitive information
